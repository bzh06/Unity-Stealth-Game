2D Unity Stealth Game

About:
This is a top-down 2d stealth game where the objective is to control the player character to the end of each level (the door) without being
seen by the hall monitors (the moving characters in the red). The goal is to beat each level as fast as possible and with as few deaths
as possible in order to obtain an "A" grade. The grading criteria is different for each level.

Controls:
WASD to move (up, down, left and right respectively)
Space bar to use "distraction" ability. The hall monitors will react to the abilities, giving the player time to move past without being seen.
Q to open up an ability menu. Currently only the top two buttons are functional, and give the player an option to make a "noise bomb" that causes
the enemies to turn in the direction of the detonation, or a "trap" that freezes the enemies when they walk into it.
